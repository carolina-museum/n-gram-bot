# n-gram-bot

## Overview
A practice of using n-grams, making a bot-like feature in Jupyter Notebook.
The bot generates a paragraph based on a given text using n-grams starting from a specific word. The user chooses n and a beginning word.

## Running the notebook
1. Run everything from the beginning. 
2. You will be asked to choose n for n-grams, so give a value of your choice. The recommended n is 2, 3, or 4. Keep running the consequent cells.
3. You will be asked to enter a word, so give one word that you would like your paragraph to begin with. Keep running the consequent cells.
4. You get a paragraph that the bot created based on your first word, the n you chose for n-grams, and the base data.

## Detail Settings
- The base data is given as a string, which you can change by replacing the string texts assigned to a variable with string texts of your choice
- n is asked to the user through standard input
- the first word is asked to the user through standard input
- a paragraph is printed through standard output
